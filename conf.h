/* These functions load and parse an ini-style configuration file:
 * 
 * ; Comment
 * [section]
 * key = value
 * 
 * A key must have a value, even if it is empty:
 * 
 * key = ; Valid
 * key   ; Invalid
 * 
 * Comments may appear at the end of any line:
 * 
 * ; Comment
 * [section] ; Hello
 * key1 = value ; Yep, this is valid
 * key2 = "hey ;-)" ; Use quotes if the value contains a semi-colon
 * 
 * Leading and trailing spaces are trimmed from keys and values. Use quotes
 * if a value must begin or end with spaces:
 * 
 * key = "  the final frontier  "
 * 
 * C-style escapes can be used inside quoted strings.
 * \" \\ \t \n and \r are supported.
 * 
 * key = "this is a\nmulti line string"
 * 
 * Keys that appear before a section decleration are part of the NULL section.
 * 
 * Sections may appear multiple times. Use index 0+ to read a key from a
 * specific section.
 * 
 * Use index -1 to read a key from any iteration of any occurrence of a
 * section.
 * 
 * If the same key appears multiple times, only the first matching instance
 * is used.
