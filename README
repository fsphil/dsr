-= dsrtx - Digitale Satelliten Radio (DSR) transmitter =-

DSR (Digital Satellite Radio / Digitale Satelliten Radio) is a wide
bandwidth digital radio standard that can carry 32x 32 kHz 16:14-bit audio
channels. These may be paired for up to 16 stereo channels.

This encoder is based on the specifications in ITU-R BO.712-1.
The output sample rate must be a multiple of DSR's symbol rate (10.24 MHz).

* Supported audio input:
- 32 khz 16-bit raw audio (mono or stereo)
- Generated test tone
- Optionally any audio source supported by ffmpeg

* Supported output:
- hackrf
- SoapySDR supported devices
- IQ file


REQUIREMENTS

Depends on libhackrf, and optionally soapysdr and ffmpeg libraries.

* For Fedora (with rpmfusion)
yum install hackrf-devel SoapySDR-devel ffmpeg-devel


WARNING

The hackrf and other SDRs are not designed to be connected directly to AV
equipment and could be damaged by, or cause damage to, your receiver. Please
ensure no DC voltages or control signals are sent back into the hackrf, and
that the RF power levels out of the hackrf are not too high for your receiver.
