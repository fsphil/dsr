-= dsr - Digitale Satelliten Radio (DSR) encoder =-

This is a highly experimental DSR encoder.

DSR (Digital Satellite Radio / Digitale Satelliten Radio) was a digital
radio standard first demonstrated in Germany in 1989, and eventually
discontinued in 1999. It is a wide bandwidth digital radio signal that
can carry 32 high quality mono channels, 16 stereo channels, or some
combination of the two.

This encoder is based on the specifications in ITU-R BO.712-1.

Tested and working on a Grundig ST-9000. It does not work with my
Sony DAR-1000ES, which may be faulty.

There's no configuration in this version, it's just a simple test. Running
the code will produce a large file called "frame.bin" in the current
directory, containing 60 seconds worth of QPSK symbols representing the DSR
signal. This features 16 stereo channels which by default are all silent.
Audio can be added by placing a RAW 16-bit stereo 32kHz file at
"audio/channel%02d.raw", where %02d represents the channel number (01-16).

A GNU Radio flow graph is provided to transmit this over a hackrf or
other compatible SDRs.

TODO

* Real time transmission directly from the main program.

* Provide an interface to configure the channels.
