-= dsr - Digitale Satelliten Radio (DSR) encoder =-

This is a highly experimental DSR encoder. It likely does not work,
or if it does it will not sound very good.

DSR (Digital Satellite Radio / Digitale Satelliten Radio) was a digital
radio standard first demonstrated in Germany in 1989, and eventually
discontinued in 1999. It is a wide bandwidth digital radio signal that
can carry 32 high quality mono channels, or 16 stereo channels.

This encoder is based on the specifications in ITU-R BO.712-1. It is
an incomplete implementation that does not work on the one receiver I own.
I'm unsure if this is the fault of my encoder or the receiver.

Usage is currently basic. Running the code will produce a large file
called "frame.bin" in the current directory, this contains 60 seconds
worth of QPSK symbols. The DSR signal contains 32 mono channels which
by default are all silent. Audio can be read by placing a RAW 16-bit
mono 32kHz file at "audio/channel%02d.raw", where %02d represents the
channel number (01-32).

A GNU Radio flow graph is provided to transmit this over a hackrf or
other compatible SDRs.
