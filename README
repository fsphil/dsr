-= dsr - Digitale Satelliten Radio (DSR) encoder =-

This is a highly experimental DSR encoder.

DSR (Digital Satellite Radio / Digitale Satelliten Radio) was a digital
radio standard first demonstrated in Germany in 1989, and eventually
discontinued in 1999. It is a wide bandwidth digital radio signal that
can carry 32 high quality mono channels, 16 stereo channels or some
combination of the two.

This encoder is based on the specifications in ITU-R BO.712-1. It is
an incomplete implementation, limited to a single scale factor, but
produces good audio quality.

Tested and working on a Grundig ST-9000. It does not work with my
Sony DAR-1000ES, which may be faulty.

Usage is currently basic. Running the code will produce a large file
called "frame.bin" in the current directory, this contains 60 seconds
worth of QPSK symbols. The DSR signal contains 32 mono channels which
by default are all silent. Audio can be read by placing a RAW 16-bit
mono 32kHz file at "audio/channel%02d.raw", where %02d represents the
channel number (01-32).

A GNU Radio flow graph is provided to transmit this over a hackrf or
other compatible SDRs.

TODO

* Implement scale factor support. This will help mask bit errors and
generally improve audio quality.

* Read time transmission directly from the main program.

* Provide an interface to configure the channels.
